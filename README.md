# Custom-Virtualized-Geometry-Renderer
A custom Virtualized Geometry LOD Rendering Engine : cluster-based real-time mesh simplification and LOD streaming system inspired by UE5's Nanite. This engine dynamically switches between multiple Levels of Detail using a virtualized geometry hierarchy, supporting view-dependent streaming and cluster-based simplification.
